# Welcome to MyVoting üó≥Ô∏è! 
**A Blockchain-based Electronic Voting System for Malaysia.**

MyVoting is a decentralized and secure electronic voting system designed for Malaysia. It is built on the **Scroll** blockchain and integrated with the **MySejahtera** mobile app. Malaysian citizens can now vote from the comfort of their homes using MyVoting, eliminating the need for physical polling stations and **reducing election fraud**. By leveraging **Ethereum-based smart contracts**, we ensure that each vote is **secure, transparent, and immutable**.
